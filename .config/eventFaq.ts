            Simply teleport to "The Brimming Heart" in the The Goblet Ward 27, Plot 19 on Odin. 
            The venue is but a brief walk from the aetheryte, across the ponds and the outside bar.
            A staff member is stationed outside to receive you.

        `
            This is a private event, and the door might therefore be locked.
            Simply approach the staff member with the yellow (Looking for party) icon. 
            They will check that your name is on the guestlist and then let you in.
